Gundren was clearly excited and more than a little secretive about his reasons for the trip, saying only that he and his brothers had found &ldquo;something big,&rdquo; and that he&rsquo;d pay you ten gold pieces each for escorting his supplies safely to Barthen&rsquo;s Provisions, a trading post in Phandalin. He then set out ahead of you on horse, along with a warrior escort named Sildar Hallwinter, claiming he needed to arrive early to &ldquo;take care of business.&rdquo;<\/p>"
